# Calculating-Confidence-Intervals
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is the Environmental Protection Agency's index for reporting air quality. A value close to 0 signals little to no public health concern, while higher values are associated with increased risk to public health. The United States is considering a new federal policy that would create a subsidy for renewable energy in states observing an average AQI of 10 or above.

Ripple Renewable Energy (RRE) is an agency that deals in Renewable Energy. RRE operates in the following U.S. states: California, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas. An analysis can be done of these states to check which states are most likely to be affected, should the new federal policy be enacted.

For this analysis:

I will provide a summary of the mean AQI for the states in which RRE operates. <br>
I will construct a boxplot visualization for AQI of these states using seaborn. <br>
Evaluate which state(s) may be most affected by this policy, based on the data and your boxplot visualization. <br>
Construct a confidence interval for the RRE state with the highest mean AQI.
